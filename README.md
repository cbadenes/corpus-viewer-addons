# Corpus Viewer Addons

`Corpus-Viewer-Addons` provides a set of distributed services to analyze texts from large document corpora in a fast and easy way.

## Features
- [NLP Toolkit](https://github.com/librairy/nlpEN-service) 
- A set of Topic Models trained from internal corpora and packaged as Restful APIs


## Quick Start

### Install Docker and Clone this repo
1. Install [Docker-Engine](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) 
1. Clone this repo and move into `src/test/docker/` directory.

	```
	git clone git@github.com:cbadenes/corpus-viewer-addons.git
	```


### Run NLP Toolkit
1. Move into `src/test/docker/nlp/en` directory.
1. Run the service by: `docker-compose up -d`
1. You should be able to monitor the progress by: `docker-compose logs -f`

- The above command runs two services: DBpedia Spotlight and librAIry NLP-EN, and uses the settings specified within `docker-compose.yml`.
- The HTTP Restful-API should be available at: `http://localhost:7777/en` 
- More info [here]()

### Run a Topic Model
1. Move into `src/test/docker/models` directory.
1. Run the model by executing the script that describes it: e.g. `./cordis-70.sh`

- The above command runs a web service and uses the settings specified within script (e.g. `cordis-70.sh`).
- The HTTP Restful-API should be available at: `http://localhost:8000/model`

### Configuration
To change configuration, just edit the [docker-compose.yml](src/test/docker/nlp/en/docker-compose.yml) or the [docker-run](src/test/docker/models/cordis-70.sh) file.

## Services
A Topic Model is described by the following services:
- `/settings` : read the metadata of the model. 
- `/dimensions`: lists the topics discovered by the model.
- `/dimensions/{id}`: explore a topic from its word distribution.
- `/shape`: build a vector with the topic distributions from a given text.
- `/inference`: build a list of topic distributions along with the top 10 words of each topic from a given text.


## Reference

You can use the following to cite the service:
